List of actions:

action1: list all records that match expression
action2: list all sorted with integer type
action3: list all
action4: list all sorted with string type
action5: remove
action6: update
action7: add

I save the changes I make on the list so running the program combined
and seperately can only have the same affect if a copy of the parts file is made and used after executing the seperate commands. If not, the list will be a different for one for the combined execution and thus
can not result in the same output.
